Topics covered in this course include the general formalism of quantum mechanics, harmonic oscillator, quantum mechanics in three-dimensions, angular momentum, spin, and addition of angular momentum. The lectures and lecture notes for this course form the basis of Zwiebach\u2019s textbook *Mastering Quantum Mechanics* published by\u00a0[MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mastering-quantum-mechanics)\u00a0in April 2022.",
