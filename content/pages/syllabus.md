Problem Sets
------------

There is a problem set every week. The main purpose of the problem sets is to help learn quantum mechanics, not to grade performance. They are included in the final grade as a safety net in the event exams do not consistently reflect a student's understanding.

Sitting down by yourself and reasoning your way through a problem will help you learn the material deeply, identify concepts that are not clear, and develop the analytical skills needed for a successful career in science. If you can solve the problems by yourself, you can expect to do well on the exams. After trying to solve a problem without success, seek help from staff or classmates. Many students learn a great deal from talking to each other. Identify what was preventing you from solving the problem and write up the solution by yourself. It is a breach of academic integrity to copy any solution from another student or from previous years' solutions. Your solutions should be logical, complete, and legible. If you cannot present a solution clearly, it is likely that you do not understand it adequately. The graders are instructed not to give credit for unclear or illegible solutions.

Exams
-----

Cumulative mastery of homework is intended to be the primary learning tool in preparation for exams. There will be an hour and a half closed-book test during the normal lecture time. There will be a three-hour final exam scheduled during the final exam period.

Grades

The relative weighting of exams and problems sets will be as follows:
